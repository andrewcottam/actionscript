			<mx:Text text="Firstly, the currently predicted worse-case scenarios for sea level rise are only for 1-2m. Secondly, it is assumed that all of the individuals within the affected colonies will be affected and will need to either move further inland or move elsewhere. The actual impact will depend on a number of factors including: rate of sea level rise; ecological requirements; habitat availability further inland; Finally, the analysis depends on the accurate height of the colonies (see data preparation below) and for cliff-nesting species the height accuracy is low." width="100%"/>
			<mx:Label text="Data preparation" styleName="toolLabel"/>
			<mx:Text htmlText="Sea level rise and colony heights have been calculated using the Global ASTER Digital Elevation Model (DEM) (http://www.ersdac.or.jp/GDEM/E/index.html) with a vertical resolution of 1m and a horizontal resolution of xx. The height for colonies was derived by overlaying the locations on the DEM and reading the height data. This is highly error-prone for colonies which are located on cliffs since a small change in location will result in a large change in height." width="100%"/>
